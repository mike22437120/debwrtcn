#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

=Pre-requisites=

Kernel:
make openwrt/all will give a list of dependencies
Root filesystem & Cross compile environment:
debootstrap, comes with any Debian or Ubuntu versions
run as normal user
gid of the normal user must be >= 1000
uid of the normal user must be >= 1000
this normal user must have sudo rights
debian packages
subversion
build-essentails
fakeroot
chroot
Do it all in one turn

make menuconfig
make V=99
Detailed build instructions

Kernel compile

make menuconfig
Select your target device type
And that should be it
( optional ) make openwrt/menuconfig
make openwrt/all V=99
binaries in bin/
follow instructions on OpenWrt how to flash the firmware to your specific device
Root filesystem creation: Stage 1

Preferably compile a kernel first, but this is not necessary
Make sure you have full sudo rights, preferably without the need for typing a password
All work is done in a chroot jail to prevent messing up the host root filesystem
make menuconfig
Select your target device type
Optional: selection Debian version
make debian/rootfs
rootfs in: build/rootfs-<ARCH>-<DEBWRT_RELEASE>-<DEBWRT_VERSION>-<RELEASE>/
install by copying manually or:
mount your USB Disk/USB Stick/SD Card/CF Card/IDE/SATA root partition with ext3 on /media/DEBWRT_ROOT
make debian/rootfs/install
it will install the rootfs in /media/DEBWRT_ROOT ( an rm -rf is done first! )
continue with stage 2
Root filesystem creation: Stage 2

Stage one prepared a filesystem with debootstrap. A DebWrt Debian root filesystem for the selected architecture(mips, mipsel, ...) has been created. It includes a default Debian installation with some important DebWrt cross-compiled packages installed. Flash the device with the appropriate DebWrt kernel. Boot the device. It will boot in 'firstboot' mode. When having a serial port, one will be able to immediately follow progress and see bash starting with some instructions. Otherwise connect to the device using ssh. Basically what needs to be done after logging in, is the debootstrap second stage install, which will install all Debian packages properly. This is a step that can not be done on the build host, because of the architecture mismatch. (I invested a lot of time in QEMU, but QEMU is not reliable for MIPS and MIPSEL. ARM works fine with QEMU )

When using SSH, the post-install instructions will not appear. Therefore see the instructions below which come from debwrt/trunk/debian/rootfs/files/init.d/rcS.firstboot:
