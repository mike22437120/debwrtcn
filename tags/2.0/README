This is the DebWrt build environment. It is heavily based on OpenWrt's build environment and heavily uses Emdebian and Debootstrap for all Debian related actions. DebWrt connects two very powerfull technologies: Debian and OpenWrt. Debian has a great package management system and includes thousands of packages for many architectures. OpenWrt has great Linux kernel support for many embedded devices. Bringing these two strenghts together opens a whole new world of possibilities.
