          If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File
          systems" section, above), you will get a file /proc/bus/usb/devices
          which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
          busses, and for every connected device a file named
          "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
          device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
          to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
          they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

          You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
          mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

          For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
          <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

          Usbfs files can't handle Access Control Lists (ACL), which are the
          default way to grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a
          desktop system. The usbfs functionality is replaced by real
          device-nodes managed by udev. These nodes live in /dev/bus/usb and

          Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported
          directly from the usbdev in sysfs. Old versions of the driver
          core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.

          These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
          information about USB interfaces must be available. One device
          contains the device node, the other device contains the interface
          data. Both devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one
          can't access the other. The device node created directly by the
          usb device is the parent device of the interface and therefore
          easily accessible from the interface event.

          This option provides backward compatibility for libusb device
          nodes (lsusb) when usbfs is not used, and the following udev rule
          doesn't exist:
            SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \

          The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
          "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
          If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
          configure this Host Controller Driver.

          EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
          or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
          will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
          connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
          probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
          Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
          Driver too.

          The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing
          USB 1.1 host controller hardware.  It does more in hardware than Intel's
          UHCI specification.  If your USB host controller follows the OHCI spec,
          say Y.  On most non-x86 systems, and on x86 hardware that's not using a
          USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host
          controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI
          based system where you're not sure, the "lspci -v" entry will list the
          right "prog-if" for your USB controller(s):  EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI.

          USB flash devices, and memory sticks, along with
          similar devices. This driver may also be used for some cameras
          and card readers.

          This option depends on 'SCSI' support being enabled, but you

	help
	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the

config EXT3_DEFAULTS_TO_ORDERED
	bool "Default to 'data=ordered' in ext3 (legacy option)"

	help
	  If a filesystem does not explicitly specify a data ordering
	  mode, and the journal capability allowed it, ext3 used to
	  historically default to 'data=ordered'.

	  That was a rather unfortunate choice, because it leads to all
	  kinds of latency problems, and the 'data=writeback' mode is more
	  appropriate these days.

	  You should probably always answer 'n' here, and if you really
	  want to use 'data=ordered' mode, set it in the filesystem itself

	  When checking out and building multiple revisions of OpenWrt it comes in handy
	  to not download all required external sources over and over again, but save them
	  in one directory. If this directory exists, during checkout, a symlink will be
	  created to it from the buidl directory of the checked out revision. Be aware that
	  if you use a relative directory here, it must be relative to 
	  "build_dir/openwrt-<board>-<revision>-<kernel>" and not to "."
