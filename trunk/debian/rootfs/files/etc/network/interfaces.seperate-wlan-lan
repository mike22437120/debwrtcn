# eth0: port 5 on ethernet switch ( Broadcom 44xx/47xx 10/100BaseT Ethernet - b44 )
#
# Note: eth0 is the ethernet device connected to the b44 switch.
#       The switch creates vlan tags for each seperate configured
#	vlan. robocfg is used to configure the switch. For security
#	reasen I would advice not to bind an ip-address to eth0 and
#	make sure you have no services connect to eth0 and/or 
#	create proper firewall rules.
#
#	eth0 needs to be enabled, otherwise eth0.wan and eth0.lan 
#	VLAN interfaces will be disabled as well. See 
#	/etc/init.d/network_switch were eth0 is enabled and the 
#	switch and VLAN's interfaces are created.
